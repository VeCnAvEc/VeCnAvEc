**A bit about myself**  
Hello!  
My name is Danil,  
and I have worked with many different areas: blockchain, backend, and even some frontend.  
I have also set up certain blockchain nodes and occasionally handled basic server configurations.  
At the moment, I prefer to focus on blockchain development and, possibly, backend work.  
My frontend skills are quite limited â€” for example, I wouldnâ€™t take on a production-level frontend,  
but I can create simple components when needed.

What have I developed in the backend field? Let me list it for you:  

```txt
1. Various types of APIs
2. Web server optimization
3. Server configuration
4. Deploying web applications
5. Integrations with various payment API gateways
6. Automation of accounting reports
7. Working with databases, I don't have much experience, but I have it
8. Using Redis for caching and backend communication(Not much experience)
9. Using RabbitMQ for message brokering(Not much experience)
```

I also tried my hand at blockchain development, which I found more interesting than backend development.  
After studying blockchain theory and the architecture of blockchain itself, I started developing various applications for blockchain.

Here's my experience in blockchain:  
```txt
1. Developed a mining pool for the Ironfish blockchain (PoW) using programming languages like Node.js and Rust.
2. Created a crypto game on a smart contract using Solidity.
3. Developed an airdrop on a smart contract using Solidity.
4. Developed two types of mining pools at HashC:
   - Mining proxy pool based on the Stratum protocol (implemented for the BTC network).
   - Mining solo pool (unfinished), with task generation, coinbase_tx creation, block mining, and reward distribution.
```

Regarding my experience in frontend development:  
In reality, I have very little experience in frontend development, and I wouldn't recommend myself as a frontend developer.  
I have worked with frameworks like React + Redux and developed UI for a crypto game. I also integrated various crypto wallets like Trust Wallet and MetaMask.  
I usually only take on frontend work in very rare cases, such as creating a very simple frontend for testing my backend application or developing a button to connect with MetaMask or Trust Wallet.

**Also, at the moment, I'm delving into DeFi,
developing arbitrage bots and MEV bots.**

Companies I have worked for:

1. [Life Style](https://www.life-style.uz/).
2. [Second World](https://secondworld.life/) <img height="20" src=".\icons\secondworld.png">
3. [Payment System Platform](https://psp.uz/ru/) <img height="20" src=".\icons\psp.uz.png">
4. [HashC] Unfortunately, there is currently no official website

**My experience at HashC**

At HashC, I worked as a blockchain developer from February 2024 to March 2025.
I was mainly responsible for the core development of our mining pool and additional tools for it.

Here are my key contributions:

1. Developed a mining proxy pool based on the Stratum protocol.
   - Aggregated network traffic from miners into a single connection
     and redirected shares to the main pool.
   - Implemented for the BTC network.

2. Worked on a solo mining pool (unfinished).
   - Aimed to build a fully functional pool with task generation,
     coinbase_tx creation, block mining, and reward distribution.

3. Integrated Redis into pool projects.
   - Used for communication between backend and frontend.
   - Planned migration to RabbitMQ or Kafka, but it was not completed.

Positions held in these companies:

```txt
1. Life Style - Intern Frontend Developer
2. Second World - Blockchain + Backend Developer
3. Payment System Platform - Backend Developer
4. HashC - Blockchain Developer
```
Duration of employment:
```txt
1. Life Style - 2 months
2. Second World - 7 months
3. Payment System Platform - 1 year
4. HashC - 1 year 2 months
```
