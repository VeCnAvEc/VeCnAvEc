**A bit about myself**  
Hello!  
My name is Danil,  
and I'm a backend and blockchain developer who has worked in several companies.   
I primarily held the position of a backend developer because my preferences lie in working with powerful servers and everything related to networks.

What have I developed in the backend field? Let me list it for you:  

```txt
1. Various types of APIs
2. Web server optimization
3. Server configuration
4. Deploying web applications
5. Integrations with various payment API gateways
6. Automation of accounting reports
7. Working with databases
```

I also tried my hand at blockchain development, which I found more interesting than backend development.  
After studying blockchain theory and the architecture of blockchain itself, I started developing various applications for blockchain.

Here's my experience in blockchain:  
```txt
1. Developed a mining pool for the Ironfish blockchain (PoW) using programming languages like Node.js and Rust.
2. Created a crypto game on a smart contract using Solidity.
3. Developed an airdrop on a smart contract using Solidity.
```

Regarding my experience in frontend development:  
In reality, I have very little experience in frontend development, and I wouldn't recommend myself as a frontend developer.  
I have worked with frameworks like React + Redux and developed UI for a crypto game. I also integrated various crypto wallets like Trust Wallet and MetaMask.  
I usually only take on frontend work in very rare cases, such as creating a very simple frontend for testing my backend application or developing a button to connect with MetaMask or Trust Wallet.

**Also, at the moment, I'm delving into DeFi,
developing arbitrage bots and MEV bots.**

Companies I have worked for:

1. [Life Style](https://www.life-style.uz/).
2. [Second World](https://secondworld.life/) <img height="20" src=".\icons\secondworld.png">
3. [Payment System Platform](https://psp.uz/ru/) <img height="20" src=".\icons\psp.uz.png">

Positions held in these companies:

```txt
1. Life Style - Intern Frontend Developer
2. Second World - Blockchain + Backend Developer
3. Payment System Platform - Backend Developer
```
Duration of employment:
```txt
1. Life Style - 2 months
2. Second World - 7 months
3. Payment System Platform - 1 year
```
